# UNGDC

The UNGDC dataset was created by Slava Jankin Mikhaylov, Alexander Baturo, and Niheer Dasandi in 2017.  See their [Github repository](https://github.com/sjankin/UnitedNations).

In this repository, I provide a mirror of their data files and a simple Jupyter notebook demonstrating how the dataset can be used to analyze and visualize trends in global diplomacy.
